Description:
    Generates a possibility to redirect to a certain URL but with also having a
    page object in the tree hierarchy of the CMS. For example, if you want to
    add a menu item at the top level but actually want to display a page that is
    placed somewhere else, you could use the redirect object to create the menu
    item and link to the actual page.

    This also, to some extend, allows to set more than one permalink for one
    object.

Example:
    `rails generate cms:component:redirect`

    CMS: object class "Redirect"
    CMS: attribute redirect_link (linklist)
    CMS: attribute show_in_navigation (enum)
    CMS: attribute sort_key (string)
