# This concern provides behavior that all CMS resources have in common.
# Resources can be Images, Videos or similar kind of generic objects, but also a
# blog post or a reference could function as a resoure. It is similar to +Page+
# and +Box+, as it allows to add behavior by composition instead of inheritance.
