Description:
    The attribute api generator is not meant to be called on the command line
    but is a helper that can be called from within a generator. It supports the
    full webservice api to be specified via arguments. See the example below on
    how to use it in your own generator.

Example:
    Attribute::ApiGenerator.new('show_in_navigation', behavior: behavior) do |attribute|
      attribute.type = :boolean
      attribute.title = 'Show in navigation'
    end
