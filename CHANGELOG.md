= v0.0.5
  * A website object can now be asked for all its homepages and returns a list of all Homepage
    objects.
  * A language switch allows to navigate from one language homepage to another. All languages are #
    listed in the sidebar. The current language is not linked.
= v0.0.3
  * Added two new rake tasks ```rake cms:info:attributes[workspace]``` which returns a list of
    attributes and their type and ```rake cms:info:obj_classes[workspace]``` which returns a list of
    object classes and their attributes. For each task the workspace can optionally be provided.
  * BoxImage now supports a link attribute, that defines if and where the displayed image is linked
    to.
  * Support for ```Redirect``` cms objects. They allow to create a navigation item, for example,
    that redirects to a different page.
  * Assets are now shared between deployments via ```before_migrate.rb``` deploy hook.
  * The body tag now holds the name of the current controller. This allows easier css scoping.
  * Included [BetterErrors](https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors) and
    [BindingOfCaller](https://github.com/banister/binding_of_caller) as core development gems. Also
    added an developer initializer file that is ignored by default.
  * The ICE Kickstarter now depends on Ruby 1.9.3. Please make sure to upgrade your Ruby version and
    use the latest Infopark gems. We recommend to use the new hash syntax throughout the project.
  * Added authorization support to simply protect access to a page via a before filter. Use
    ```before_filter Filters::Authorization``` in your controller to protect the entire page.
  * Complete refactoring of user management. Separated application user model from its remote user
    model by introducing an application wide user manager. A default implementation is given for the
    Infopark WebCRM. This makes it possible to easily swap the user manager to LDAP for example. A
    mapper class is used for the communication between the two, possibly different, user models.
    Have a look at ```app/models/user.rb``` for how it is implemented exactly.
  * Added optional contact_page component that is connected to the WebCRM and prefills email, when
    user is logged in. Call ```rails generate cms:component:contact_page```.
  * Added ICE Developer Dashboard mounted under ```/cms/dashboard```. The dashboard
    is only available for local requests and completely separated from your Ruby on Rails
    application.
  * Bugfix: Workspace Toggle no longer displays an empty list, when there is only one workspace.
  * Changed ```rake cms:deploy:live``` to ```rake cms:deploy``` as there is no other environment yet.
  * Added optional google analytics generator. Tracking ID and Anonymize IP Setting can
    be configured in the CMS for each homepage. Default settings can be given as generator
    options.
