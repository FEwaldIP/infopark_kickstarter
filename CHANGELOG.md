= v0.0.3
  * Bugfix: Workspace Toggle no longer displays an empty list, when there is only one workspace.
  * Changed ```rake cms:deploy:live``` to ```rake cms:deploy``` as there is no other environment yet.
  * Added optional google analytics generator. Tracking ID and Anonymize IP Setting can
    be configured in the CMS for each homepage. Default settings can be given as generator
    options.
