Infopark Kickstarter provides generators and rake tasks to quickly setup or enhance an
[Infopark](http://infopark.de) Ruby on Rails project. All generated code
represents a working example, but can be fully customized within the application.


## Installation and Usage

Please visit our Dev Center to get the
[latest installation and usage information](https://dev.infopark.net/kickstarter).


## Testing

There are two types of tests. First there are rspec tests of the Infopark Kickstarter
engine. You can run these tests by simply calling:

    $ rake spec

There are also integration tests, that can be run by:

    $ rake test:integration

In order to run the tests successfully, you need to download the application configuration from the
[Infopark Console](https://console.infopark.net) and unpack it into the ```config``` folder. See the
contributing section below for more information.

The integration tests are rather slow, because they create an entire new application, execute
```rails generate cms:kickstart``` and run all the other generators and then execute the tests of
the newly created application. Therefore, all tests can also run on the Continuous Integration
platform [Travis](https://travis-ci.org).


### Continuous Integration with Travis

As the Infopark Kickstarter is a public repository, it is easily possible for you to run *Continuous
Integration* tests of your fork with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) as you develop new features. In
order to run all Kickstarter Tests on the platform you should:

1. Fork the
   [Infopark Kickstarter GitHub repository](https://github.com/infopark/infopark_kickstarter).

2. Sign In at Travis with your Github Account.

3. Enable the Travis Webhook for your `infopark_kickstarter` fork.

4. Run `gem install travis` on your local machine to install the travis command line client.

5. Download the configuration files for your Ruby on Rails application from the Infopark console and
   run the following command with your configuration filled in accordingly. Make sure to insert the
   name of your forked GitHub repository `<your-github-account>/infopark_kickstarter`.

        travis encrypt CONTENT_SERVICE_URL=<content service url> -r <github repository> &&
        travis encrypt CONTENT_SERVICE_LOGIN=<content service login> -r <github repository> &&
        travis encrypt CONTENT_SERVICE_API_KEY=<content service api key> -r <github repository> &&
        travis encrypt CMS_URL=<cms url> -r <github repository> &&
        travis encrypt CMS_LOGIN=<cms login> -r <github repository> &&
        travis encrypt CMS_API_KEY=<cms api_key> -r <github repository> &&
        travis encrypt CRM_URL=<crm url> -r <github repository> &&
        travis encrypt CRM_LOGIN=<crm login> -r <github repository> &&
        travis encrypt CRM_API_KEY=<crm api key> -r <github repository>

  Please add the *secure* output to the `.travis.yml` file and add a comment with your GitHub name
  above. You find examples for other contributers in the file.

If you now push commits to your forked repository or send a pull request, travis will automatically
run all tests for you and indicate the build status.


## Changelog

See [Changelog](https://github.com/infopark/infopark_kickstarter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more
details.


## Contributing

We would be very happy and thankful if you open new issues in order to further improve Infopark
Kickstarter. If you want to go a step further and extend the functionality or fix a problem, you can
do so any time by following the steps below.

1. Signup for a [free Infopark account](http://www.infopark.de/) and setup a test CRM
   and CMS component in the Infopark console.

2. Fork and clone the
   [Infopark Kickstarter GitHub repository](https://github.com/infopark/infopark_kickstarter).

        git clone git@github.com:_username_/infopark_kickstarter.git
        cd infopark_kickstarter

3. We suggest using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/) for managing your local Ruby
   version. Make sure to use at least Ruby version 1.9.3.

        ruby --version

3. Download the configuration files for your Ruby on Rails application from the Infopark console and
   copy them to your cloned Kickstarter gem `config` folder.

        config/rails_connector.yml
        config/custom_cloud.yml


4. Create the bundle and run all test to make sure everything is working before you add your own
   changes. You find some more details about testing above in the __Testing__ section.

        bundle
        rake spec
        rake test:integration

5. Create your feature branch and create a pull request for the `develop` branch. Please take a
   look at the already existing generators and rake tasks to get an impression of our coding style
   and the general architecture.

6. We are using the [GitHub Styleguides](https://github.com/styleguide) and would prefer if you
   could stick to it.
